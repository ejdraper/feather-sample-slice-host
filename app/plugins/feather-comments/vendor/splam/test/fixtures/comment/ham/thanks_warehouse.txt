Thanks for the info Rick. I'm pretty sure I got all the dreamhost stuff worked out correct. I think I may be getting confused with paths/database connections. Let me try to ask a small set of simple questions and see if that gets me on track.

Let's say I want this at warehouse.mysite.com.

1) I'm assuming I upload the *contents* of the warehouse tar file (the "application") to warehouse.mysite.com. I then make sure Dreamhost is pointing to the "public" folder that was part of these contents. Is this correct?

2) Now I need to tweak some files. How many? From the directions it looks like 4:  htaccess, enviroment.rb, dispatch.rb and dispatch.fcgi. Is there any way to know if my tweaks were "correct" or not? You mention the database.yml file: do I also need to manually change the database.yml file myself (for a total of 5 modified files), or will the part where I initialize the database do this for me? How exactly do I change the Ruby paths (this is the part I'm least sure about as I'm not familiar with Ruby syntax).

3) I run "rake warehouse:bootstrap" and answer all the questions to connect the app to my database. If successful it finishes and says "Warehouse is ready to roll". I got this far: does this mean everything is theoretically okay or does this not really tell me anything. How do I know if there's a problem if I get no error?

4) The last step should be me navigating to warehouse.mysite.com and getting some sort of install screen. Is this correct? This is the part I'm not getting, just a "rails application failed" page.

(In case it's useful info: in messinga around I did manage to ssh into the dreamhost server and type "rails blah blah" which caused it to install a bunch of files that successfully give me the default "Welcome to rails" screen when I navigate to warehouse.mysite.com. I'm taking this to mean that rails itself is running okay).

Again, thanks for your time and I apologize for my ignorance in these types of things. I'm slowly learning...
