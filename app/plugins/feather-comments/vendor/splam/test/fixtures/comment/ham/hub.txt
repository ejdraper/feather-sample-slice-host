Currently I'm working on a project with one other person and we are using this application as our central hub to communicate with each other and monitor 'trackers' that we have setup for our development.

The only problem we have with the service right now is the fact that when one of sets the responsibility ownership to one-another we would like to receive email notifications stating that "Posted Item to Work On" now belongs to you, or something along those lines.

If this is built it, did we do something wrong which is preventing this from happening? Also I'm not sure if this was posted already or not, and I did search for it.
