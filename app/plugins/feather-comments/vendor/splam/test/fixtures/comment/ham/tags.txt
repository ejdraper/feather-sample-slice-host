I came across a post on searching on multiple tags (http://forum.activereload.net/forums/4/topics/534), but I have a somewhat different problem.  Apologies if this has been covered before.

I'm searching for open tickets without patches in Rails.  If I search for this (copied directly from the search box): 

    state:open not-tagged:patch tagged:activerecord

then I get 64 results.  However, if I search for this:

    state:open not-tagged:patch

then I get zero results.  I've found no way to create a search that returns what strikes me as a potentially popular query.  I'd appreciate any direction.
