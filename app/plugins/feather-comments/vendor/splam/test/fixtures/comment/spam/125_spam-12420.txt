<b>Do any of you still chat in Yahoo Chat?</b> 
I stopped using yahoo chat over a year ago after it was completely over ran by spam bots and arabs. But out of curiousity I logged in the other day to see if it had gotten any better but of course it's worse than ever. I think there were probably 15 bots toevery 1 real person in there.  I also noticed that they got rid of most of the adult rooms. It's nothing but a joke now, not even sure why they haven't just pulled it offline by now. 
 
I did come accross a new chat site called Oohya.net <a href=http://oohya.net><b>Chat Rooms</b></a> the other day. It seems pretty good, a lot like yahoo chat with webcams, voice, and profiles unlike most of the other cheesy chat sites out there, but I didn't see any bots at all. Only problem I saw was it just doesn't have the user base yahoo had. If it gets bigger I think it will be good. 
 
I did try paltalk for a few days but after getting booted out of the rooms over and over by arrogant room mods I gave up on that pretty quick, plus they make you pay for all of the features.  Anyone know of any other good free chat rooms?
