Rick -

Thanks again.  I, after wrestling with a case of dyslexia, got it to work with you suggestion. I wasn't encoding the colon for some reason.  Idiot me.

I'm probably going to put together a little 'dummies guide' for the API once I get done with this projects, because I think it would help others who might have had some similar initial glitches.

THANKS for a great product!
