Ok, further along. Under Mongrel all seems to be working. Though it would have been nice if the version number in the big download button after purchasing indicated beta.

Now, Site5 like Dreamhost I suppose requires things like this to run under FastCGI. Ok fine.. So here is what I have done.
I am basically getting this in my error log:
[Mon Oct 15 01:14:54 2007] [warn] FastCGI: (dynamic) server "/home/bgcode/public_html/dispatch.fcgi" has failed to remain running for 30 seconds given 3 attempts, its restart interval has been backed off to 600 seconds

So, I did some searching and testing. First thing I did was rails testrails to create a new rails app. symlinked its public to my public_html. Modifed the .htaccess with RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L].
Hit the domain from the web browser. Sweet. The rails welcome page. Just as you would expect.

Removed the symlink to public_html, and recreated with /home/me/warehouse/current/public ( I let rake warehouse:setup do the directory structure ). Made the same changes to .htaccess.

I also had to correct the path to ruby in all three dispatch files to: #!/usr/bin/env ruby

Next, a visit to environment.rb to un-comment ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'production' as recommended in the Dreamhost instructions. 

I played around trying and untrying a few other things, but no dice. Same deal. Works great in Mongrel but that just won't fly. I don't expect you guys to know what crazy setup Site5 has, just looking for some direction to take.
