Hey everyone this is my first post so hello. Just a basic question for everyone about webcam online dating Why I will need to type personal info or credit card to can access the webcams? Is it secure? Most of webcam online dating ask 4 credit card and explains that as "Credit Card is required for age verification only. You will never be charged anything!" Please tell me about your experiences. Also if everyone would name a place or two they dating online, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!http://www.100-free-web-host.com/nata1/smile1.jpg
