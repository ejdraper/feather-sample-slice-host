README

This is a sample host app to demonstrate running Feather as a slice. It includes a few plugins installed by default:
	feather-comments
	feather-feeds
	feather-importers
	feather-tagging
	feather-themes

The sqlite3 database file is included, so that this app should fire up and work straight away in development mode.

The Feather blog admin username and password is "admin", and "password".

It comes with an incredibly simple override theme by default, just to show how it works.

The blog and the host app use different layouts, just to show that the layouts can be separated.

You can use this as a base for building your own Feather powered apps. Any bugs/issues, please let me know by e-mailing me at el@ejdraper.com.
